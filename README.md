The Mars Rover is exploring an area on Mars which is a grid measuring 100 metres by 100 metres. The squares are numbered from 1 to 10,000.

The rover starts in square 1 facing south and can either turn left, right or move forward a given number of metres.

The rover can only take a maximum of 5 commands at a time after which it reports back its current position and the direction that it is facing.

The rover cannot cross the perimeter of the exploration area. It will halt and refuse to execute any additional queued commands.
